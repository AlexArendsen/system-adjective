# system-adjective

My laptop setup, complete with installation scripts! More readme goodness to come!

## Installation

The scripts in `install/` are designed to both initialize new systems with my
setup, as well as modify / repair existing ones. To have everything in the
system checked over or installed, run the `install/all.sh` script.
